# ReinforcementLearningBasic 
As a group of si-guo-jun-qi chess game players, we have a dream to create an AI agent , somehow like alphaGo, to play the Si-Guo-Jun-Qi. But for the moment, we need some sort of necessary AI knowledge to make the magic happen. From alphaGo , we guess the deep reinforecement learning may be the feasible way, therefore we decide to dive to the reinforement learning as the first step. 

This repository is created just for learning the RL 
The recommended resources are listed as below:

1.  The MOOC :  Reinforcement learning from Udacity .  https://cn.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600
2.  The book:    Reinforcement learning: an introduction 2nd Edition.   http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html
     It is highly recommended to run the source code programmed for this book and take your own experiments.  
     
     
 
 # The programing language
 The programming lauguage is not decided yet but Python will be the first option.  Today, Python is supported by most of the machine learning  frameworks and becomes a de facto standard programming language. There are lots of python code bases and ML library that could be leveraged.
